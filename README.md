# Module-8
##Summary of Learnings
From module 8.1 to module 8.5, I have learned a lot of things pertaining to the usage of different methods and functions in pandas to collect, query, merge, apply operations, aggregate, and manipulate the time index in data and data frames, all for the purpose of processing data to efficiently manage, analyze and derive insights from it, which would otherwise not be possible if presented raw. At the end of the day, I realize that all of these are merely tools — software tools — that we can use to enhance our capabilities in making data-driven decisions, which I would get to ultimately use once I solve real-world problems in the future.
